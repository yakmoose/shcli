# sitehost-cli

This project implements a simple cli tool for working with the [sitehost.nz](https://sitehost.nz) api.

More information about the API can be found at [https://docs.sitehost.nz/api/v1.2/](https://docs.sitehost.nz/api/v1.2/)


It's a work in progress, and you use it at your own peril as there may be dragons.
